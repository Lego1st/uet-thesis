\chapter*{Abstract}

As humans are the ultimate receivers of the majority of visual signals being processed, the most accurate way of assessing image quality is to ask humans for their opinions of an image’s quality, known as the subjective visual quality assessment (VQA). The subjective image quality scores gathered from all subjects are processed to be the mean opinion score (MOS), which is regarded as the ground truth of image quality. Conventionally, a number of full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods adopted various computational models of the human visual system (HVS) from psychological vision science research.

Due to the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is differently sensitive to features of image patch, we propose Deep Image Patch Quality Assessment (DIPQA), a novel image patch quality assessment that used deep neural network-based approach. An experimental quality assessment to approach database for image patch has been developed. The network is train end-to-end and comprises 8 convolutional layers and 4 pooling layers for feature extraction, and 2 fully connected layers for regression, which make it significantly deep enough to learn the mean opinion score (MOS) of the developed dataset.

We promise that this project was contributed by all members in our group, which are supervised by Ph.D. Le Thanh Ha and M.Sc. Pham Thanh Tung from HMI Lab. The report contains no materials previously published or written by another person except where due reference or acknowledgement is made.
